# Forest Cover Type Prediction

An intelligent web application to predict **forest cover types** using geographical and environmental parameters. Built with **Streamlit** and powered by **XGBoost**, this tool enables researchers, forestry managers, and environmental analysts to make data-driven predictions about forest ecology.  

---

## Overview

The **Forest Cover Type Prediction System** classifies forest patches into one of **seven vegetation types** based on environmental features. It supports:  

**Batch Prediction**: Upload a CSV dataset to process multiple forest patches simultaneously.  
**Single Patch Prediction**: Enter 54 environmental parameters for a detailed prediction.  
**Visual Insights**: Interactive charts, probability distributions, and downloadable reports.  
**User Customization**: Multiple themes (Light, Dark, Tree) for an enhanced experience.  
**Intro Voice Assistant**: Provides a guided briefing on first use.

## Technical Details

**Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (custom themes and interactivity)  
**Backend Model**: [XGBoost Classifier](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/)  
**Dataset**: [UCI Forest Cover Type Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype)  
**Accuracy**: ~94% on validation data  
**Features Used**: Elevation, Aspect, Slope, Soil Type, Wilderness Area, Distance to Hydrology/Roads/Fire Points, Hillshade values.  

## Forest Cover Types Mapping

The original dataset used **numbers (1â€“7)** to denote vegetation types. For improved **readability and usability**, these were mapped to **forest type names**:

| Number | Cover Type Name          |
--------------------------------------
| 1             | Spruce/Fir                       |
| 2             | Lodgepole Pine              |
| 3             | Ponderosa Pine              |
| 4             | Cottonwood/Willow      |
| 5             | Aspen                              |
| 6             | Douglas-fir                     |
| 7             | Krummholz                     |

This conversion ensures users understand predictions without referring back to raw codes.
